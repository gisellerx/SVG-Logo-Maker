# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

When I am prompted for text
Then I can enter up to three characters
When I am prompted for the text color
Then I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
When I am prompted for a shape
Then I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
When I am prompted for the shape's color
Then I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
When I have entered input for all the prompts
Then an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
And the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
When I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
